# Project Memory

This file is the persistent handoff record for the project.

## Current state
- Current phase: Development & Verification Complete
- Current module: Completed Modules 1–24
- Overall status: Ready for Review & Deployment

## Last completed work
- Analyzed all reference screenshots (`nickho-motorsports.nl/#media`) and confirmed tech stack.
- Ingested all user data from `data (2).json`.
- Configured React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS with strict `border-radius: 0px` tokens and `#FDD60A` yellow accent.
- Built all reference sections: HeroProfile, StatementSection, ArcGallery, TimelineSection, CaseStudiesSection, EcosystemGrid, Footer, Header, and modals.
- Executed landing page hero cleanups:
  1. Removed `AKASH` from top-left of landing hero.
  2. Removed `EDITORIAL PORTFOLIO` from top bar.
  3. Removed `EVERY RELEASE IS A TEST, NOT JUST OF SYNTAX` quote text.
  4. Implemented transparent navbar with 'AD' monogram and yellow 2-bar hamburger.
  5. Calibrated career identity:
     - Role: `FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPER`.
     - Current Role & Availability: `FULL STACK DEVELOPER AT NRITHYA DANCES`.
     - Active Stack: `FULL STACK AND AI`.
  6. Simplified Section 02 (Core Philosophy):
     - Removed left and right flanking image columns completely.
     - Removed mobile image cards completely.
     - Removed bottom "Akash Frontend" line and divider.
     - Reduced text size of the central statement to a clean, balanced `text-2xl sm:text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl` with `leading-snug sm:leading-tight`.
  7. Optimized Section 03 (ArcGallery):
     - Constrained strictly to `100vh` (`h-screen max-h-screen overflow-hidden`) so the entire layout fits in the viewport without vertical scrolling.
     - Incorporated navigation buttons `<` and `>` directly within the 100vh viewport alongside the interactive speedometer dial.
     - Implemented true continuous 3D orbital carousel flow: all 3 project cards are simultaneously rendered and smoothly spring-animated between left flank, center prominence, and right flank based on dynamic circular offsets (`diff = -1, 0, 1`).
     - Enabled universal horizontal gesture dragging across the entire orbital track, the cards, and the floating `DRAG ⇄` badge.
     - Implemented precise directional mechanics: clicking the right button `>` or dragging to the right glides the center card (LifeOS) to the right flank and brings the left card (RedConnect) into the center. Clicking `<` or dragging left brings the right card (HireFlow AI) into the center.
     - Clicking on flank cards directly rotates them into the center.
     - Reduced navigation button sizes to sleek, compact `w-7 h-7 sm:w-8 sm:h-8` with crisp 14px icons.
  8. Transitioned to Full Stack Web Developer Everywhere:
     - Removed Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) and positioned developer as Full Stack Web Developer across all data objects, hero metadata, navigation overlay, footer identity badge, timeline badges, skills categories, and HTML/JSON-LD meta tags.
- Verified production build (`tsc -b && vite build`) with zero errors.
- Connected GitHub remote: `https://github.com/akashad123/akash-portfolio.git` and pushed branch `main`.

## In-progress work
- Live preview active on local port 3001.

## Important decisions
- Centralized data layer in `src/data/portfolioData.ts` adhering strictly to user's provided JSON data.
- Enforced `border-radius: 0px` globally across all components.
- Mobile-first responsive hierarchy: 12-col desktop, 6-col tablet, 4-col mobile.

## Known constraints
- Strictly static architecture with serverless client-side email dispatch fallback.

## Known issues
- None.
